# RCOInstaller

## ⚠️I DID NOT MAKE RCO⚠️

This is only an alternative client to auto-install RCO. If you would like to use the original RCO installer, please visit [https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer]()! Don't submit issues about the optimization here, submit those to the [RCO discord server](https://roblox-client-optimizer.simulhost.com/discord)!

# About

Yet another RCO installer. This one is a fork of ShashTheEpic's RCO-Auto-Installer, which does most of what I wanted the original RCO installer to do except a few things which I added to this project. **THIS PROJECT IS WINDOWS-ONLY!!**

# Features

* Get the latest version of RCO installed to the proper folder, hassle-free.
* Automatically run the program when you start your computer
* Super simple. Run the application once and it's all installed.
* doodoo code written by yours truly

# FAQ

### Why does this exist?

I never really liked the original RCO installer, mainly because it never seemed to work for me. I don't know if anyone else experienced problems with it but I just found it confusing to use and it didn't put the json file into the folder most of the time. I sought out to make an alternative installer, and RCO-Auto-Installer was a perfect base for it.

### What's the difference between RCO2/RCO3 and RCOInstaller?

It installs the same json files, I just made RCOInstaller to greatly simplify the process.

### How do I use this?

Download the EXE file from [the releases tab](https://github.com/hdboye/RCOInstaller/releases/latest). Open the EXE file. Enjoy.

### My Roblox just updated and the optimizations don't work anymore.

Open the file again, or restart your computer. The first one should be easier though.

### How do I uninstall RCO using RCOInstaller?

Uninstallation is a bit trickier for now. Type `%localappdata%\Roblox\Versions` in the search bar of your pc, then check both folders for a folder called ClientSettings. If you see a folder called ClientSettings, open it and delete the json file that's in there.
